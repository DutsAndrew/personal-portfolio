This is a portfolio summing up my most recently worked on projects and my current resume.

<strong>Build:</strong>

In this project I used a "tasteful" amount of animations and transitions without overdoing anything. The goal of this project was to make a dynamic and visually appealing portoflio that was useable on the web and mobile.

In particular this project utilized the ARIA and WCAG guidelines to make a more accessible web page by using semantic HTML for users with web-readers.

<strong>Tools:</strong>

ReactJS, TypeScript, CSS, Animations, Transitions, Keyframes
